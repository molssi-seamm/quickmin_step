2022.10.23 -- Properties added
    Added a single property, 'total energy#QuickMin#<forcefield>', to store the final
    energy in the database. Also added 'total energy' as a result for tables or
    variables.

2022.10.22 -- Documentation!
    Got the documentation into reasonable shape.

2022.10.20 -- Initial Release!
    Provides quick minimization for smaller molecules, using OpenBabel. Probably
    reasonable for some few hundred atoms. Supports the following forcefields:

       1. GAFF
       2. MMFF94 & MMFF94s (which is optimized for minimization)
       3. Ghemical
       4. UFF

    The default is the "best available" forcefield, which tries them in the order given
    above until it finds one that can handle the molecule.
