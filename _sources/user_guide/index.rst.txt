The QuickMin plug-in provides quick minimization for smaller molecules, using
OpenBabel. Probably reasonable for some few hundred atoms. Supports the following
forcefields:

1. GAFF
2. MMFF94 & MMFF94s (which is optimized for minimization)
3. Ghemical
4. UFF

The default is the "best available" forcefield, which tries them in the order given
above until it finds one that can handle the molecule. 

The following sections cover accessing and controlling this functionality.
