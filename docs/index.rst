QuickMin optimizes the (non-periodic) structure using a forcefield. It is intended for
smaller molecules, with no more than a few hundred atoms, beyond which point the
calculation will become noticeably slow. Also, larger systems usually have many
energetically similar conformers, so should be sampled using a conformer search method.
