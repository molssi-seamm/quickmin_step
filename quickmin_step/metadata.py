"""Properties that QuickMin produces.
`metadata["results"]` describes the results that this step can produce. It is a
dictionary where the keys are the internal names of the results within this step, and
the values are a dictionary describing the result. For example::

    metadata["results"] = {
        "total_energy": {
            "calculation": [
                "energy",

Fields
______

calculation : [str]
    Optional metadata describing what subtype of the step produces this result.
    The subtypes are completely arbitrary, but often they are types of calculations
    which is why this is name `calculation`. To use this, the step or a substep
    define `self._calculation` as a value. That value is used to select only the
    results with that value in this field.

description : str
    A human-readable description of the result.

dimensionality : str
    The dimensions of the data. The value can be "scalar" or an array definition
    of the form "[dim1, dim2,...]". Symmetric tringular matrices are denoted
    "triangular[n,n]". The dimensions can be integers, other scalar
    results, or standard parameters such as `n_atoms`. For example, '[3]',
    [3, n_atoms], or "triangular[n_aos, n_aos]".

methods : str
    Optional metadata like the `calculation` data. `methods` provides a second
    level of filtering, often used for the Hamiltionian for *ab initio* calculations
    where some properties may or may not be calculated depending on the type of
    theory.

property : str
    An optional definition of the property for storing this result. Must be one of
    the standard properties defined either in SEAMM or in this steps property
    metadata in `data/properties.csv`.

type : str
    The type of the data: string, integer, or float.

units : str
    Optional units for the result. If present, the value should be in these units.
